                <h2>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hey there, I'm Irteza! I'm a 4th year Mathematical Sciences student
                        at the University of British Columbia graduating in December 2024. 
                        Mathematical Sciences is a Math, CS, and Stats
                        joint degree offered by UBC that features coursework in all three disciplines. 
                        My interests are in Software Development, Data Science 
                        and Game Development. You can reach me with any of the social media
                        links above!</p>

                        <p class="CardText">Using the Unity Engine and C#, I developed a top-down
                            2D bullethell game named Starbound. Visual and Auditory assets were either 
                            repurposed from assets found in game asset stores or created in Aesprite/Audacity.
                            The project demonstrates use of Data Structures, Algorithms and OOP Class Structure.
                            Multivaritate algebra and geometry skills were needed to create interesting enemy patterns. 
                            Coroutines were used to implement multitasking and complex sequences.</p>

                        <p class="CardText">I created a charting module for a desktop application created in 
                            Microsoft's Windows Forms framework using C#. The application would take data in 
                            the form of a CSV file and prompt the user to select various parameters 
                            of varying data types. The application plots the provided data with axes that adjusted 
                            to the ideal range with custom zoom functionality. I implemented multichart functionality,
                            which allowed the user to overlay charts, adjusting axes and units automatically.</p>

                        <p class="CardText">A website I made to learn the fundamentals of CSS/HTML. In particular, I used
                            this project to get familiar with CSS's Box Model and Flexbox framework. It showcases some
                            of my projects, essentially acting as a resume in website form. Themes, design, and colors
                            were taken from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project's</a> module on fundamentals.

                        <p class="CardText">For a school project, I designed a working menuing system in Java.
                            It allowed for users to change various visual aspects of a user configuration, auditory 
                            levels of sound effects and background music, as well as name the configuration. 
                            The application saves/loads the desired settings in JSON format and loads user configurations
                            as desired. The project made use of Unit Testing to create robust methods and classes.

                        During my time at Petrobeacon, I updated and managed large (100,000+) SQL databases. 
                        I used Power BI to visually present the data extracted from the databases using Queries. 
                        I worked in C# and markup languages to bring the data to clients in the form of an online cloud-based web service.</p>
